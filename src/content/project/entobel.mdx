      Entobel is a pioneer in sustainable insect protein and has recently opened one of the world’s largest insect production facilities in Vietnam. This cutting-edge black soldier fly farm operates at industrial scale, featuring **vertical insect rearing with robotics, sensors, and data analytics to enhance productivity**. As the Lead Data Analyst at Entobel, I was tasked with transforming the factory’s raw data streams into actionable business intelligence. The goal was clear: **enable data-driven operations** in real time, from tracking volumes procuced, costs induced, raw material availabilities in order to support daily decision-making by leadership.

## Challenges

Running a high-tech insect farming operation at scale presented several data challenges:

- **Siloed and Delayed Information:** Information on raw material stock levels and production metrics was scattered across spreadsheets and manual logs. By the time reports reached decision-makers, they were often outdated.
- **Unclear Production Costs:** Calculating the true cost of production (from larvae hatch to processed protein meal) was labor-intensive and infrequent.
- **Rapid Scale and Complexity:** With Entobel expanding to a commercial-scale facility, data volume and complexity grew exponentially. Multiple departments needed to **share a single source of truth**.

## End-to-End Data Solution Overview

I took full ownership of architecting and implementing an **integrated data infrastructure** to meet these challenges. The solution spanned the entire data lifecycle  from collection on the factory floor to dashboards in the boardroom.

### 1. Centralized Data Platform

All relevant data streams (inventory transactions, sensor readings, production logs, purchase orders, etc.) were connected to a central data repository. I developed custom ETL processes and DBT models to clean and combine the data. This unified platform broke down departmental data silos while maintaining strict access controls.

### 2. Real-Time Raw Material Monitoring

A major initiative was live tracking of the factory’s raw material stocks (e.g. feed ingredients for the larvae). I integrated inventory and IoT data to update stock levels continuously. **Power BI dashboards** now display current stock levels with color-coded alerts for low thresholds. This real-time visibility helps prevent stock-outs and ensures the millions of larvae are always fed adequately.

### 3. Actual Production Cost Tracking

I developed a robust cost tracking model combining data from production, procurement, and finance. Costs such as feed, energy, labor, and equipment runtime are now captured and allocated to production batches. Interactive **Power BI reports** show cost per kg, budget variances, and trends. Leadership can drill into cost drivers to improve efficiency.

## Power BI Dashboards for Daily Decisions

  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <div style={{ height: "1rem" }}></div>
    All processed data feeds into **Power BI dashboards used daily by Entobel’s leadership team**. I designed multiple dashboards:

    <div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "flex-start", gap: "1.5rem" }}>
      {/* <img
      src="/src/assets/powerbi.png"
      alt="Power BI Dashboard"
      style={{
        maxWidth: "100px",
        width: "100%",
        borderRadius: "12px",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)",
        objectFit: "cover"
      }}
      /> */}
      <div>
      - **Executive Dashboard:** Daily refreshed overview of inventory, production output, and unit cost.
      - **Operations Dashboard:** Live metrics for production managers, enabling real-time adjustments.
      - **Financial Dashboard:** Tracks actual costs and margins for strategic budgeting.
      - **Procurement Dashboard:** Monitors supplier performance, purchasing cycles, and raw material price trends to support cost-effective sourcing decisions.
      - **R&D Dashboard:** Tracks experimental feed trials, growth rates, and biological performance metrics to accelerate innovation in insect farming.
      - **KPI Tracker:** Consolidates cross-departmental performance indicators (finance, ops, sales) in one place to align the entire company around strategic goals.
      </div>
    </div>

    Dashboards are interactive and drillable, fostering trust and empowering teams with timely, accurate data.

## Outcomes and Impact

- **Real-Time Visibility:** Prevented feedstock stock-outs and enabled proactive inventory planning.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Provided unprecedented transparency into production cost structures.
- **Decision-Making:** Leadership now starts each day with data-driven discussions based on live dashboards.
- **Cross-Department Alignment:** Created a single source of truth trusted by all departments.
- **Scalability:** The data architecture supports future expansion to new sites and product lines.

## Conclusion

    <p>
      For a rapidly scaling agritech company like Entobel, such a data foundation is critical.
      It turns the immense complexity of farming millions of insects (and the volumes of data they generate)
      into clarity and direction for the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, data has become a strategic asset at Entobel, guiding decisions that drive sustainable growth
      and innovationexactly what a modern, data-driven enterprise strives for. My work at Entobel
      showcases the impact of marrying technical skill with business focus: the ability to listen to operational needs,
      build a tailored data solution, and ultimately, deliver insights that propel the company forward.
